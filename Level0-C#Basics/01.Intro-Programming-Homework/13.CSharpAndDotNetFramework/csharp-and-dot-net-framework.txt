	 C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, 
	functional, procedural, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming 
	disciplines.  C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLR). 
	C# is built on the syntax and semantics of C++, allowing C programmers to take advantage of .NET and the 
	common language runtime. 

	 .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily 
	on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large library and provides language interoperability (each language 
	can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET 
	Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as the Common 
	Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory 
	management, and exception handling. The class library and the CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
